## Code and source data

Chiba, G., Ozaki, Y., Fujii, S. & Savage, P.

To reproduce the main analyses and create the figures: first clone the repository, and then run the script `run_all.R` (R script) under the `experiments` folder.

The rest of the three folders, `Reanalysis of Tsay (2013) and Mehr et al. (2018)`, `new-pilot-data_power-analysis`, and `pilot-data`, include codes used in the Stage 1 Registered Report submission.

This codebase was developed on R 4.2.1.
